EvalVid - A Video Quality Evaluation Tool-set
EvalVid is a framework and tool-set for evaluation of the quality of video transmitted over a real or simulated communication network. It is targeted for researchers who want to evaluate their network designs or setups in terms of user perceived video quality.

Besides measuring QoS parameters of the underlying network, like loss rates, delays, and jitter, standard video quality metrics like PSNR and SSIM and a subjective video quality evaluation metric of the received video are provided.

Currently H.264, MPEG-4 and H.263 are supported. AAC support is also included, though the perceptual quality evaluation has to be done by external tools implementing dedicated metrics like PESQ or PEAQ.
